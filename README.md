Week 1 Task 3 the theme for my data set will be the song Swing Low sweet chariote. it is a song created in 1917 and has been made into different genres the one I shall be using is a romantic version according to the freemusic archive of the piece and has been written in 1917 and it appears to be one of the first.

Task3 my piece of music has a great deal of data created with it as it is a popular song it has been notated, recorded, downloaded and sold on music streaming services such as spotify and apple music etc.  It has been sung by many different people one of the most recognisable versions is Judy Garland which she recoded on the 24th of octbober 1937 for the film everybody sing.
